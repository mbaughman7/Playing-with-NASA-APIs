import requests
from datetime import datetime
import tkinter


# find NASA APIs that are available for GET requests.
# start with one.  A dropdown menu will come later. First,
# do one mission.
# Create button that executes the GET request (no parameters, at first)
#
# output will depend on the payload of the response from the API.
# consider payload of csv in txt file or an image file.
# possibly, output is simply info displayed in a text box on tkinter box.
# good starting place is US map game, pomadoro timer project, and iss_overhead project
